# NBASalaryPredictor
NBA salary predictor using regression models in R. Credit goes to Koki Ando on Kaggle for inspiration and datasets


## Overview

Hello all! As a student in Toronto and a long time NBA fan, basketball in the North has never been sweeter. That being said, I got some serious concerns. That is, teams continually tie themselves to players via large contracts when the performance of a player may not indicate they deserve said salary. Thus, taking inspiration from Koki Ando on Kaggle I will create a NBA Salary Predictor using simple regression models.

To be specific the goal is to look at the season performance in 2016-2017 to predict the salary they should make in a season.
